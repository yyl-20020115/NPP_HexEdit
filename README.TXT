A branch of the hex editor plugin for Notepad++.  The original can be found at http://sourceforge.net/projects/npp-plugins/files/Hex%20Editor/Hex%20Editor%20Plugin%20v0.9.5/.

The purposes of this branch are to

1. Display data as the alternative hexadecimal symbols described in http://mackwai.blogspot.com/2015/06/alternative-hexadecimal-digits-version-2.html
2. Fix bugs in the hex editor.

This version of the plugin was developed and built with Visual Studio 2010 Express.  As of October 11, 2015, alternative hex sybmols display correctly and some bugs have been fixed, but these changes have only been verified in Windows 7 with the Unicode version of Notepad++.

The status of the bugs recorded on Sourceforge.net are as follows:

274: not reproduced
266: fixed
241: same as 266, fixed
215: NOT fixed or investigated
188: maybe same as 274; not reproduced
